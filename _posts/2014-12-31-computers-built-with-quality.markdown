I have been using computers for almost 20 years now. I primarily used custom assembled PCs in the beginning in late 90s. I started assembling PCs after year 2003 myself after researching the computer parts and making the best choice that was suitable for my needs. I also started using laptops manufactured by dell and hp around year 2005.

I always had one or the other type of failure with these laptops and it was very frustating experience after paying good enough money for it. I felt that I was paying just about similar amount of money for these OEM machines in comparison to my self-assembled PCs. And I was realizing that my self-assembled PC hardware served me very well in comparison. I was using DOS or Windows OS all along.

If I were to buy a laptop from business section and pay top dollars, I can get better quality machine. But manufacturers don't seem to build enough quality into home section laptops even if you were to pay top dollars because some of the money goes into better speakers and shiny skins whereas RAM, motherboard and other parts suffer. I am talking about manufacturer better be investing into RAM and motherboard.

I think Apple choses best quality parts possible to build their devices. Of course, they charge money for that quality hardware. For the same amount of money, you could get a good quality windows laptop too. But, recently after year 2012 mac prices have gone way more competitive.

While mac prices became competitive and windows 8 was introduced as a usability failure, I switch to macbook pro and can't admire the hardware quality enough. The battery is phenomenal and last longer. As far as OS is concerned, I think windows will get lot better with windows 10 (and 11) and I may switch back, but for now I will enjoy the beauty of mac hardware and sleek OS.
