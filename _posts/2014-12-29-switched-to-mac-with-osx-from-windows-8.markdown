**Background**

I have been using windows operating system for my software development and home use for years. I have been generally very happy with that being a savvy user, specially because windows allowed lot more control than what apple's system did for years.

**Windows 8**

With the launch of Windows 8, things changed in the windows world as well only to disappoint and discomfort the users. Windows 8 may have been a great improvement in terms of performance and file system and many other great features which end users may not notice. Microsoft attempted to make the UI synergies between windows phone and windows desktop to take advantage of the usage trends of social applications. While it may have been a good idea and effort, it was not done with good user experience and certain things became difficult to use.

When I installed windows 8 for the first time, it took me couple of minutes to find the shutdown button. It was under settings on the right dock. How does shutdown action belong under settings?? Not much wrong doing by Microsoft but the OS was not designed for savvy users or developers like me who just want to get things done. It came into my way than help me.

**Mac trend**

Right around the time when iPad 3 launched, apple's Mac OS X operating system was also getting nice improvements specially with safari web browser and few advantages of apps eco system for mac. FaceTime and iMessage were welcome additions for the OS.

I had been hearing and noticing the improvements of OS X and how more people have been starting to use it. I also noticed the pricing going down every single year when they launched new models.

I knew that Microsoft will come back and make improvements but I thought this is a good time for me to get out of Microsoft & Windows eco system and try something new - Mac OS - just for a change, if nothing else!

**Moving on**

Since I have to use development tools on windows, I would still need some virtualization software like parallels desktop or vmware fusion on mac to let me continue to use windows. This would also require good processing power. So, I thought I may need to opt for quad-core processor and not settle with dual-core. While I would have loved the portability of 13" macbook pro, quad-core was available only with 15". I still went to apple store on 2 different days to try out the machines and OS just to make sure that I am comfortable. 

While I was in the store, I inquired about return policy! The rep told me about worry free / question free full-refund return policy of 14 days. I can try my virtualized windows and performance and if I'm not pleased, I can return back to my windows machines! I said, I am in for the ride!

I got MGXA2LL/A - 15" quad-core macbook pro.

* 2.2 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7 Processor (Turbo Boost up to 3.4 GHz, 6 MB shared L3 cache)
* 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3L RAM; 256 GB PCIe-based Flash Storage
* 15.4-inch IPS Retina Display, 2880-by-1800 resolution
* Intel Iris Pro Graphics
* OS X Mavericks, Up to 8 Hours of Battery Life

I went home and delighted myself with my first laptop that finished full booting process in 11 seconds! I simply love the way text looks on my iPad and it's equally true now for 15" retina mac. I was pleased with using some of the gestures on  the trackpad which I was very curious to try. I must say that mac's keyboard, trackpad and the display were the best I had ever used on any laptops so far. Battery life is phenomenal and charging is faster than I've ever seen on my other laptops. 

I will end by saying that I like both ecosystems and they are good in their own rights and bad in their own ways. I am convinced that it is also possible to find a convincing windows laptop by paying similar high price. Dell XPS 15 (business) was going to be my choice if I didn't go with mac.
