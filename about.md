A software enthusiast's personal web site to share software tips, tricks and research. 
I also would like to share some of the photos I've been taking.

I built the site to take advantage of free hosting at [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com).
I used [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) for CMS (templating).

I am very excited about building this site with these technologies and plan to share my thoughts on photography, technology, software and more.

See you around!
